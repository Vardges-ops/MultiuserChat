the first user should be the system, to send messages : User related
if user was deleted, his records shouldn't be deleted : User related
create pydentic field checker objects for corresponding DB model to reduce mistake probability
think about id generators for advance filter usage, after their development, use them in entity's
when the current day changes, all active conversations should be closed and new ones opened, if
when forwarded message renders to a specific conversation, then load conversation
IMPORTANT ! Investigate and create room access options table, like permission to delete, edit message
Change where filter is done with id column, replace with query.get() method
